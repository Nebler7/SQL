SELECT COUNT(orderid) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE Product = "iPhone"; 

--Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT c.acctnum FROM BIT_DB.FebSales fs 
JOIN BIT_DB.customers c 
ON fs.orderid = c.order_id;

--Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct product, price 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE price 
IN (SELECT MIN(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);

--What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT product, SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
GROUP BY product;

--Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product, SUM(quantity), SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales

GROUP BY product;

--How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(c.acctnum), AVG(quantity*price) 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales fs 
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers c
